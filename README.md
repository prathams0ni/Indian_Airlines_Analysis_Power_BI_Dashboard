   - Ensured consistent format for categorical fields  
   - Verified numerical ranges (duration, prices)

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created `days_left hist` for smoother visuals  
   - Derived time-of-day categories  

3. **Data Modeling**  
   - Structured into star-schema style table  
   - Optimized fields for Power BI visuals  

4. **Visual Analytics**  
   - Built KPI cards for summary

## 🧩 Data Modeling

A simple, optimized model:

This design ensures:
- Faster load time  
- Better DAX performance  
- Clean visuals without redundancy  

---

## 📈 DAX Measures Used

DAX:
Avg Price = AVERAGE('Indian Airlines'[price])

Airlines Count = DISTINCTCOUNT('Indian Airlines'[airline])

Avg Duration = AVERAGE('Indian Airlines'[duration])

Total Bookings = COUNTROWS('Indian Airlines')

Economy % = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Indian Airlines'), 'Indian Airlines'[class] = "Economy"),
    [Total Bookings]
)

Business % = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Indian Airlines'), 'Indian Airlines'[class] = "Business"),
    [Total Bookings]
)

## 🧾 Conclusion

The analysis of Indian domestic airlines reveals clear patterns in customer behavior, airline performance, and pricing strategy. Economy class continues to dominate the market, supported by strong demand for affordable travel options. One-stop flights being the majority indicate limited direct connectivity on several routes, highlighting potential opportunities for airlines to expand non-stop services.

The pricing analysis shows that customers benefit significantly from early bookings, while airlines adjust fares based on demand and time proximity. Vistara emerges as the leading airline in terms of bookings, showcasing strong brand preference and operational efficiency.

Metro cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, and Hyderabad form the backbone of domestic air travel, with high intercity movement. Additionally, morning and early-morning flights being the most preferred reflect traveler convenience and business-related travel patterns.

Overall, the dashboard provides actionable insights that can help airlines optimize pricing, improve route planning, enhance customer experience, and strengthen competitive positioning in the Indian aviation market.
